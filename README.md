Users can register, log in, and exchange messages instantly through a responsive, user-friendly interface.

    Backend: Express.js with Socket.IO for real-time communication

    Authentication: Basic login and registration flow

    ⚠️ If the app doesn’t respond right after login/registration, give it a moment — the server might be waking up from sleep.
